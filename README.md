# House-Price-Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model developed to predict house prices based on various features. 

The dataset used for this project contains Column: Price(target variable), area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, mainroad, guestroom, basement, airconditioning, hotwaterheating, parking, prefarea, furnishingstatus and have total 545 enteries. Before training the models, the dataset undergoes thorough EDA to gain insights and
identify key features for model training.

Employed feature encoding to preprocess and transform the data, ensuring optimal performance of the models.

Implemented both Linear Regression and Random Forest models to compare and evaluate their predictive abilities.

Measured model performance using the R2 score on training and testing datasets.

This project honed my expertise in data science, machine learning, and Python programming, providing valuable insights into real-world problem-solving and data-driven decision making.
